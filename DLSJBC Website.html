            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Baptist de La Salle was born into a world very different from our own. He was the first son of wealthy parents living in France over 300 years ago. Born at Reims, John Baptist de La Salle received the tonsure at age eleven and was named Canon of the Reims Cathedral at sixteen. Though he had to assume the administration of family affairs after his parents died, he completed his theological studies and was ordained a priest on April 9, 1678.Two years later he received a doctorate in theology. Meanwhile he became tentatively involved with a group of rough and barely literate young men in order to establish schools for poor boys.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time a few people lived in luxury, but most of the people were extremely poor: peasants in the country, and slum dwellers in the towns. Only, a few could send their children to school; most children had little hope for the future. Moved by the plight of the poor who seemed so “far from salvation” either in this world or the next, he determined to put his own talents and advanced education at the service of the children “often left to themselves and badly brought up.” To be more effective, he abandoned his family home, moved in with the teachers, renounced his position as Canon and his wealth, and so formed the community that became known as the <b>Brothers of the Christian Schools</b>.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His enterprise met opposition from the ecclesiastical authorities who resisted the creation of a new form of religious life, a community of consecrated laymen to conduct gratuitous schools “together and by association.” The educational establishment resented his innovative methods and his insistence on gratuity for all, regardless of whether they could afford to pay. Nevertheless De La Salle and his Brothers succeeded in creating a network of quality schools throughout France that featured instruction in the vernacular, students grouped according to ability and achievement, integration of religious instruction with secular subjects, well-prepared teachers with a sense of vocation and mission, and the involvement of parents.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, De La Salle pioneered in programs for training lay teachers, Sunday courses for working young men, and one of the first institutions in France for the care of delinquents. Worn out by austerities and exhausting labours, he died at Saint Yon near Rouen early in 1719 on Good Friday, only weeks before his sixty-eighth birthday.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Baptist de La Salle was a pioneer in founding training colleges for teachers, reform schools for delinquents, technical schools, and secondary schools for modern languages, arts, and sciences. His work quickly spread through France and, after his death, continued to spread across the globe. In 1900 John Baptist de La Salle was declared a Saint. In 1950, because of his life and inspirational writings, he was made Patron Saint of all those who work in the field of education. John Baptist de La Salle inspired others how to teach and care for young people, how to meet failure and frailty with compassion, how to affirm, strengthen and heal. At the present time there are De La Salle schools in 80 different countries around the globe.<br><br>

            <p class="data_content">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DLSJBC was initially founded in the mid-'50s as the Bislig Bay Elementary School, established exclusively for the dependents of the Bislig Bay Lumber Company Incorporated (BBLCI - the forerunners of the Paper Industries Corporation of the Philippines or PICOP which was one of the biggest paper mill companies in Asia that time). In 1961, the company turned over the management of the school to Fr. Alberto Grol, then-parish priest of Brgy. Mangagoy in Bislig, after the permission of Msgr. Charles Van den Ouewelant. Fr. Grol then converted the Bislig Bay Elementary School into a parochial school that allowed access of non-company dependents.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on in the years 1962-63, the parochial school was converted into an elementary school for girls under the name St. Margaret Mary School managed by the Augustinian Recollect Missionary Sisters (ARM). Fr. Grol then envisioned the establishment of a school for boys with the blessing of the Bishop and the financial assistance of Don Andres Soriano (co-owner of BBLI) who readily accepted the idea on the condition that the proposed boys' high school would be put up in Brgy. Mangagoy, near where the BBLI of the Andres Soriano Corporation was located. About the same time, the Don Bosco School in Mandaluyong was supposedly planning for a pattern school in Davao City. Negotiations went fast and in 1963, the Salesian Fathers of Don Bosco agreed to manage the school and the company committed to subsidize its operations with the focus on training young males who could answer the increasing demand for skilled workers at the company.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964, a number of teachers from Don Bosco Mandaluyong assigned in Mangagoy became the pioneering staff of the St. John Bosco Technical High School. The school was located at the former parish convent in Mangagoy and used part of the church as classrooms. Fr. Grol was then replaced by Fr. Henry Raam, MSC, under whom the school became the recipient of the United Nations’ “Tools for Freedom”. At the same year, the St. Margaret Mary School also opened its High School Department for girls. In 1967, St. John Bosco Technical High School and St. Margaret Mary School's first batch of high school students graduated. Meanwhile, in 1968, the Augustinian Recollect Missionary Sisters' contract to manage the school expired, and the Maryknoll Sisters were invited to take over the management of St. Margaret Mary School. The following year (1969), High School girls of nearby St. Margaret Mary School were transferred and merged with St. John Bosco Technical High School, thus making it a co-educational institution. After the merging was completed, it was renamed as the John Bosco School (JBS) and was permanently transferred to its present location in La Salle Drive, John Bosco District, Barangay Mangagoy. Sister Blaise Lupo then took over the directorship in 1970.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, the Jose Maria Soriano - Learning Center (JMS-LC), a La Salle-Supervised school in Brgy. Coleto, also in Bislig, was established by PICOP (then BBLI) for the benefit of the children of the company employees living in Forest Drive Village which is 13 kilometers away from the company. The school was then appointed a Brother-Supervisor, Br. Thomas "Tom" Cannon, FSC as the first school director.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1977, as the Don Bosco Fathers were slowly departing, the last batch of the Maryknoll Sisters also left Bislig and the administration and supervision of John Bosco School was formally turned over to the De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines. Br. Tom Cannon also became the Brother-Supervisor both in JBS and JMS-LC. In 1982, by the supervision of Br. Mifrando Obach, FSC (who replaced Br. Cannon), John Bosco School and the Jose M. Soriano - Learning Center were merged thus making it a school with 2 campuses, the Main campus located in Mangagoy and the JMS-LC campus located in Coleto, still bearing the name John Bosco School.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, PICOP Resources, Inc. (PRI) withdrew its financial assistance to the school and the JMS-LC was then phased out and all of its operations were transferred to JBS Main campus. Also in that year, JBS pre-school department was completed with the addition of a nursery school. JMS-LC was then converted into the St. Br. Miguel Retreat and Training Center to serve as venue for recollections and trainings, and workshops not only for the school, but also for interested users in the local community.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, John Bosco School became John Bosco College (JBC) with the opening of its College Department. Starting from that year onwards, JBC was accredited by the La Salle Schools Supervision Office and in 2006, the school was officially accepted as a District School of De La Salle Philippines. With Mrs. Bro. Ophelia S. Fugoso, AFSC as the School President and Bro. Narciso "Jun" Erguiza, FSC as the LaSallian Brother representative and school supervisor, the acceptance ceremony was on February 2007 making it the 18th district school of the De La Salle Philippines thus renaming it now as the De La Salle John Bosco College. The school's current president is Mr. Pablo "Jun" N. Jordan, Jr.
